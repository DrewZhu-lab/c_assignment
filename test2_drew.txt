    .h 1 Heading One This is random text that has no
    message and no real meaning. It's sole purpose is
    to test comp10002 assignment 1 programs.

    And nothing else... .h 2 Heading Two It has some
    second level headings
    some ".b" commands and some .p commands.

    .h 2 Heading Three It also has more second level
    headings.

    And more paragraph breaks, even though there was
no real reason to put one there, well, whatever.

                    And it has a section of text
          that is in much narrower
          margins, created using the
".l" and ".w" commands.

        And then back to the indent that was default from
    the beginning, and back also to the original text
    width. .h 1 Heading Four .h 2 Heading Five Wow,
    whatever, totally exciting, not! But if your
    program can process this input file then there is
    a reasonable chance it can process the other
    secret test files that will get used during the
    submission testing after submissions have closed.

    Don't forget to include the Authorship Declaration
    in your submission (see
    https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/ammoffat/teaching/10002/ass1/ass1-skel.c
    to get a copy of it), and don't forget to sign it.
    .h 2 Heading Six .h 3 Heading Seven .h 2 Heading
    Eight .h 3 Heading Nine .h 3 Heading Ten Plus some
    text that goes into that subsubsection. .h 1
    Finally

    Ok, whatever.

                   End of Input
